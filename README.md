<h3>Requirement 100.0: Store, View and Edit Income</h3>
<h4>Scenario</h4>
<p>As a User, I want to be able to enter the various incomes that are available to me into the application to store it, so that I can view it or edit it later. This data should be available to other parts of the application for data comparisons.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
   <p><strong>1.1</strong></p>
   <p><strong>Given</strong> I have no stored income data in the application</p>
   <p><strong>When</strong> I open the Money Manager Application</p>
   <p><strong>Then</strong> I should be notified that I have no existing income data and I should be prompted to enter new income data</p>
   <p><strong>1.2</strong></p>
   <p><strong>Given</strong> I enter a new income item</p>
   <p><strong>Then</strong> I should be prompted to select the relevant additional information (e.g., amount, frequency, etc.)</p>
   <p><strong>1.3</strong></p>
   <p><strong>Given</strong> I have previously stored income data in the application</p>
   <p><strong>When</strong> I choose the View Income option</p>
   <p><strong>Then</strong> my stored income data should be displayed in the application</p>
   <p><strong>1.4</strong></p>
   <p><strong>Given</strong> I have previously stored income data in the application</p>
   <p><strong>Given</strong> I am viewing previously stored income data</p>
   <p><strong>When</strong> I choose the Edit option for any given income entry</p>
   <p><strong>Then</strong> each previously entered field for that income should be editable</p>
   <p><strong>1.5</strong></p>
   <p><strong>Given</strong> I have previously stored income data in the application</p>
   <p><strong>Given</strong> I am viewing previously stored income data</p>
   <p><strong>When</strong> I choose the Delete option for any given income entry</p>
   <p><strong>Then</strong> the income item should be marked as deleted and removed from the list of income items</p>
   <p><strong>1.6</strong></p>
   <p><strong>Given</strong> a stored income item is already existing in the Money Management Application</p>
   <p><strong>When</strong> I attempt to add the item again</p>
   <p><strong>Then</strong> I should receive a prompt notifying me that the item is already on the list with the option to cancel my entry, update the previously entry or add a duplicate item.</p>
